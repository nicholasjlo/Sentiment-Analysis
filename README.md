# Sentiment-Analysis

Sentiment analysis falls under the umbrella of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning. Essentially, it is used to determine whether text has a positive or negative connotation, often referred to as opinion mining or emotion artificial intelligence. These "emotions" can be indicators of business boosters or detractors.
